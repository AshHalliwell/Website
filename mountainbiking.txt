Learn to ride in control, have more confidence on the bike, go faster and of course have a huge amount of fun.

Suitable for all levels of mountain bikers from beginner through to advanced, all age groups, and all fitness levels. 

One on One private session. You choose the time, I’ll select the trail and off we go.

If you haven’t got a bike – no problem. I can provide you with one, plus a helmet.

I can pick you up, set you up with a bike (or you can bring your own).
