Looking for a coach to get you started? Or perhaps you have a particular event you would like to prepare for.




I can either take you out on a run or ride, or write you a programme that will be easy to follow and guarantee results.




Take the advice from ex-pro-elite triathlete, Catherine Dunn who has represented New Zealand at the sport of triathlon at the Commonwealth Games and numerous world championships.


If you are already competing internationally I can offer advice from what I have learnt along the way.


Costs:

$150 for each 4 week programme
