Whether you are a local Wellingtonian or a visitor to our beautiful city I can accommodate your fitness and adrenalin needs. If you are staying in a hotel I can collect you, provide a bike and helmet and take you road or mountain biking, or take you running on the many trails around Wellington, or do a workout in my boutique gym or the greater outdoors.


Perhaps you are a little unsure negotiating the trails by yourself? Let me help!
