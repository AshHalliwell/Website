Want to have some company on your bike and ride somewhere you haven’t ridden before? If you’re looking for hills or flat, safe roads, I know all the places in Wellington. 


Need to get more out of yourself than what you can get riding alone? I can motivate you to go harder on the hills, offer professional advice on all aspects of road riding, and prepare you for any up and coming races.






I have prepared many programmes for up and coming triathletes to help them reach their goals on the bike.






Costs:   4 week programme $150


One on one accompanied ride - $60 for an hour/$100 for two hours/$150 for two and a half hours/$200 for three hours
