Experience the joy of running off-road in the trails around Wellington. Let me show you the secret pathways that feature native flora and fauna, amazing birdlife and wonderful vistas, all while getting fit, burning calories, developing muscle.


Perhaps you are visiting Wellington and are unfamiliar with the tracks, or perhaps a little apprehensive of running them alone. I can collect you from your hotel and head for the hills, or flat, whatever you prefer.




Let me, Catherine Dunn, qualified running coach, Xterra Off-road World Champion, Wellington Tough Guy/Gal women’s winner, show you the way.
