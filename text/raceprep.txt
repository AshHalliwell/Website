If you are looking for a conditioning coach to write programmes for you then I have the experience and expertise to do so.


Having represented New Zealand at elite level in the sports of triathlon, mountainbiking, duathlon, off-road (Xterra) triathlon I have the background to put all that I have learned into your programme. I also represented New Zealand at the Commonwealth Games in the sport of triathlon, was 2nd woman overall at Oceania Cycling Championships in Mountainbiking, 2006 World Age Group Champion at Xterra Off-road Triathlon Champs, Hawaii, and closer to home was 2nd overall at Motutapu Triathlon, and previous overall women’s winner of Tough Guy/Gal race in Wellington.


I have successfully trained triathletes to make New Zealand age-group teams, provided conditioning programmes for floorball and inline hockey players in preparation for international events, and can help you lift your game too.


Costs:  $150 for 4 week programme
