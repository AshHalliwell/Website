Whether you are visiting our beautiful city of Wellington or a local resident, I can help you explore some of the many magnificent trails which we have all over the city. Within minutes of the CBD you can be surrounded by bush, the only sounds that of the birds, overlooking the stunning harbour.


Let me convert you to the pleasures of getting fit on the trails while experiencing the joy and freedom where all the senses are rewarded, and your body, spirit and mind transcend to a higher level.

Sturdy shoes must be worn and a jacket carried.
